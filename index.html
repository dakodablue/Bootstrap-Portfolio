					<h1>About Me</h1>
					<img src="http://via.placeholder.com/200x200" class="auth-image" alt="Cat picture">
					<p>I was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area with the exception of moving to the Pacific Northwest from ages 5 to 10 where I would call Seattle and the surrounding area home due to my mother landing a job with Microsoft in the early 90's.  I was exposed to Graphic/Web Design very early on, due to it being my mothers profession, and spent much of my time outside of school on my mom's PC playing around with DOS, KidPix, old school side scroll video games like Duke Nukem, Apogee's Raptor, WarCraft, Doom, etc.  And when I could get my hands on a Macintosh, I spent countless hours playing Halo's predecessor Marathon.</p>
					<p>A few years later (around 7-8) I'd find myself browsing Angelfire and Geocities sites, but only after hearing the sweet cacophony of garbled atonal resonance of a 56k dialup modem attempting to establish a connection.  Later this evolved into AOL instant messenger, bearing my soul on LiveJournal, then onto MySpace where I ended up connecting with and making a name for myself through my music which utilizes outdated, legacy hardware to create what kids these days refer to as 'beats'.</p>
					<p>Long story short, I've been around computers and on the internet for almost 24 years, and I'm 30, and in that time I've amassed well over 10gb worth of client websites (sizes per site are usually 10mb but can get up to 100mb depending on the client) that I've had something to do with.  Whether it was doing database entries on SQL server, building stored procedures, wiring up smtp servers or credit card forms, installing SSL certificates, etc. to swapping out hardware, performing diagnostics and solving customer problems, I live and breathe this work.</p>
					<p>My primary skillset surrounds applications built in Visual Basic and .NET, t-SQL and Sql Server, jQuery, Ajax, HTML5, CSS3 but mostly rely on Skeleton or Bootstrap as base templates for Frontend UI.</p>
					<p>My previous work experience predominantly revolves around building membership databases, credit card payment forms, library archives, etc. using complex views linking categories in 1 db to books in another and so on as an example.  A few clients I've worked for include:<br>
						<ul>
							<li>Pasta Pomodoro</li>
							<li>Super Duper SF</li>
							<li>Donna Belajac Casting</li>
							<li>Childrens Hospital of Oakland</li>
							<li>Spiritual Competency</li>
							<li>Association of Transpersonal Psychology</li>
							<li>Redwood Psychological Association</li>
						</ul>
